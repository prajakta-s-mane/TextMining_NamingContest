# TextMining_NamingContest

Text mining plays an important role in many industries because of the prevalence of text in the interactions between customers and company representatives. Even when the customer interaction is by speech, rather than by chat or email, speech to text algorithms have gotten so good that transcriptions of these spoken word interactions are often available. To an increasing extent, a data scientist needs to be able to wield tools that turn a body of text into actionable insights. In this homework, we explore a real City of Syracuse dataset using the quanteda and quanteda.textplots packages.
