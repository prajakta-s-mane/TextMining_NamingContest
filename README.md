# TextMining_NamingContest

Text mining plays an important role in many industries because of the prevalence of text in the interactions between customers and company representatives. Even when the customer interaction is by speech, rather than by chat or email, speech to text algorithms have gotten so good that transcriptions of these spoken word interactions are often available. To an increasing extent, a data scientist needs to be able to wield tools that turn a body of text into actionable insights. In this homework, we explore a real City of Syracuse dataset using the quanteda and quanteda.textplots packages.

Syracuse brought the new snow plows and now they are having the new naming contest for the ten snow plows.
In December, the winning names were announced.
Those names included: Below Zero Hero, Beast of the East, Control Salt Delete, Golden Snowball, Lake Effect Crusher, Jocko, Abominable, Blizzard Beater, Winged Warrior, and Salt City Express
There were 2000 submissions. Some are duplicates so total 1948 observations were unique.
some submissions have the similar game and out of those only 2 people submitted for the winning game
